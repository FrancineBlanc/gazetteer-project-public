# Gazetteer-Project
## Overview
This single page web app returns various information about a selected country and the user's location (or location of the user's IP address should the user not choose to share their location).

After the website has loaded, polygons are drawn onto the map around the country representing the user's location. 

On selecting a country from the navigation bar, the map will display markers which indicate cities and landmarks for that particular country and will also pan to the country. Once all of the data is loaded, when an area on the chosen country is clicked, or the buttons beneath the zoom button is clicked, modals will pop up pertaining to the selected buttons showing various data for that country. Clicking an actual marker on the map will give the name of the particular city or landmark.

This code was previously contained on a private repository, so please get in touch with me directly if you wish to see the full commit history.
